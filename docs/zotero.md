[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is a free, easy-to-use tool to help you collect, organize, annotate, cite, and share academic research.

Zotero collections can be imported into a workspace, where you can query them.

Additionally, you can use the `zotero` command to upgrade items in a Zotero collection to improve their metadata, including abstracts, keywords, and more.
