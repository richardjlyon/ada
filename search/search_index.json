It allows you to interact with your documents in a conversational manner, using the power of ChatGPT to summarise, analyse, and generate content. The model is run locally on your own machine, so you can be sure that your data is secure and private.</p> <p>The application is designed to work with Zotero, a reference management software. You can import your Zotero library into the application, create workspaces for different collections, and interact with the documents in those workspaces using natural language queries.</p> <p>The application is designed to be easy to use and flexible, allowing you to focus on your research and writing without getting bogged down in the technical details. The language model can summarise documents, answer questions, generate content, and more, making it a powerful tool for researchers, writers, and students.</p>"},{"location":"#usage","title":"Usage","text":"<pre><code>&gt; ayda import --source zotero climate\n...\n539 PDFs imported to workspace 'zotero-climate'\n\n&gt; ayda list\n\nWORKSPACES\nfolder-logseq\nzotero-climate\nzotero-covid\nzotero-politics\n\n&gt; ayda chat zotero-climate\n\nPrompt:\nSummarise Berger 2016 \"Interglacials of the last 800,000 years\"\n\nBerger (2016) discusses the interglacial periods that have occurred during the\nlast 800,000 years. He describes these periods as relatively short-lived\nintervals between glacial advances, characterized by warmer temperatures and\nincreased biotic productivity. The most recent interglacial period, known as\nthe Holocene, began approximately 11,700 years ago and is currently ongoing.\nBerger also highlights the importance of Milankovitch cycles in shaping these\nclimate oscillations, specifically changes in Earth\u2019s orbital parameters and\naxial tilt.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>Github - https://github.com/richardjlyon/ayda</li> <li>crates.io - ayda</li> </ul>"},{"location":"commands/","title":"Commands","text":""},{"location":"commands/#create","title":"create","text":"<p><code>$ create &lt;WORKSPACE_NAME&gt;</code></p> <p>Create an empty workspace with name <code>&lt;WORKSPACE_NAME&gt;</code>.</p>"},{"location":"commands/#list","title":"list","text":"<p><code>$ list</code></p> <p>Lists all workspaces.</p>"},{"location":"commands/#delete","title":"delete","text":"<p><code>&gt; delete &lt;WORKSPACE_NAME&gt;</code></p> <p>Deletes workspace with name <code>&lt;WORKSPACE_NAME&gt;</code>.</p> <p><code>&gt; delete --all</code></p> <p>Delete all workspaces and embedded documents.</p>"},{"location":"commands/#import","title":"import","text":"<p><code>&gt; import --source zotero|folder|item &lt;SOURCE_NAME&gt;</code></p> <p>Import data from Zotero, folder or item to workspace with name <code>&lt;SOURCE&gt;-&lt;SOURCE_NAME&gt;</code>.</p> <p>e.g. <code>ayda import --source-type folder /Users/richardlyon/InterestingDocs</code></p>"},{"location":"commands/#chat","title":"chat","text":"<p><code>&gt; chat &lt;WORKSPACE_NAME&gt;</code></p> <p>Chat with workspace <code>&lt;WORKSPACE_NAME&gt;</code>.
