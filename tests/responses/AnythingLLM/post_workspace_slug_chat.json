But a  \nsubjective measure can give useful data provided the size of the uncertainty can be gauged  \nand is not too large  for the application at hand .   \nHumans use subjective assessment of the size and distance to objects in many day - to - day  \nactivities. Driving a car requires an extremely   good ability to judge the distance and speed of  \napproaching cars; or judging if the size of a parking bay, or gap between two objects, is big  \nenough for their car. Ball sports from football to snooker also require a remarkable ability to  \njudge distances. T raining and practice is the key to minimising uncertainty margins.    \nSubjective measures are also used in other fields such as teachers marking exam papers,  \nessays and even answers to mathematics questions (when the answer deserves part marks).  \nThese subjective measures can then be ‘added’ or aggregated in some objective fo rm to  \n  \n107",

Civil servants working on climate policy may take these models for granted without empirical criticism, leading to potential biases or misinterpretations (as suggested in Context 2). Additionally, the technical models of economics can be corrupted by those seeking support for specific policy narratives in a context of great uncertainty (Kay and King, Radical Uncertainty, 2020). Despite these limitations, climate models remain valuable tools for understanding complex environmental systems and informing decision-making.",
